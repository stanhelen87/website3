It is a separate system. The sandbox API does not really sent faxes. Randomly, some of your faxes will fail in the sandbox to let you test the failure case. Most of the faxes will just be reported as successfully sent, although the fax never really was sent.\nThis also applies to PamFax Credit in the sandbox - it's just virtual money. You can add as much PamFax Credit to your PamFax test account using the function Shopping/AddCreditToUser as you want. You can then use the PamFax Credit to test the sending process. We also provide a test fax number so you can test receiving faxes.\n\nWe have created a new PamFax user for you in the production system and sandbox system with PamFax Credit for testing purposes:\nUsername: {username}\nPassword: {password}\n\nOnce you have completed the development, send us an email to devsupport@pamfax.biz with a description of the solution and a few screenshots.

Scendix Software makes no representation that materials in the Site are appropriate or available for use in your location. Those who choose to access this Site from any location do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. We explicitly are not responsible for content on websites that we link to and these links are provided for informational purposes and are to be used at your own risk. We do not carry any responsibility for content posted by registered or non-registered users on the forum or any social platforms like but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, etc.\n\n\n<b>Indemnity</b>\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Scendix Software, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of content you submit, post to or transmit through the Site, your use of the Site, your connection to the Site, your violation of the Terms of Use, or your violation of any rights of another person or entity.\n\n \n<b>Governing Law</b>\n\nBy accessing this Site, you and Scendix Software agree that all matters relating to your access to, or use of, this Site shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Neither the UN-treaty (CISG) nor any other existing or future bilateral or international treaties, even if implemented into German law, shall be applicable.\n\n \n<b>Trademarks</b>\n\nThe trademarks, logos and service marks (\"Marks\") displayed on this Site are the property of Scendix Software or other third parties. You are not permitted to use the Marks without the prior written consent of Scendix Software or such third party, which may own the Marks. Scendix Software, the Scendix Software logo are trademarks of Scendix Software.\n\n \n<b>Fax Privacy</b>\n\nScendix Software acknowledges that documents contain proprietary and confidential information. Scendix Software agrees to keep the documents in confidence and to take reasonable precautions to ensure that data is stored securely, no unauthorized individuals have access to the documents and that no unauthorized copies are made. For privacy reasons sent faxes are deleted automatically after one month from your fax history, except the history of Pro Plan subscribers where the history is retained. It is your responsibility to download copies, should you need them. Communication between the PamFax application and our servers is completely SSL encrypted.\n\n \n<b>Payment</b>\n\nYou shall pay Scendix Software, via respective payment processing company (Gate2Shop, Paypal or other available payment companies), any applicable rates as stated on the website in connection with your purchase of respective products or services.\n\n\n<b>Refunds</b>\n\nWhen you purchase Paid-For-Products directly from Scendix Software you will be entitled to a cancellation period of fifteen (15) days (a “Cooling-Off Period”) unless you have made use of the Paid-For-Products in any way, in which case the Cooling-Off Period will be extinguished and your purchase cannot be cancelled or refunded.\n\nOutside of the Cooling-Off Period, only subscriptions are refundable unless used or expired.\n\nExpenditure of PamFax Credit, allocation of a Fax Number, or use of any aspect of a subscription amounts to “use” of a Paid-For-Product. You hereby expressly agree that Fax Numbers may be allocated before the end of the Cooling-Off Period.\n\nThe Cooling-Off Period and refunds do not apply to Paid-For-Products that are (i) purchased via a third party partner of Scendix Software (please contact the partner directly, who may decide in its sole discretion whether or not to pay a refund), (ii) not directly acquired online from Scendix Software (e.g. vouchers or pre-paid cards) and (iii) paid for and allocated to your Scendix Software Account by a PamFax Company Manager administrator.\n\nIf you believe that Scendix Software has charged you in error, you must contact Scendix Software within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges which are more than 90 days old.\n\nScendix Software reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably believes (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same Product; (ii) if you are in breach of these Terms or (iii) if Scendix Software reasonably suspects that you are using our Products or Software fraudulently or that your User Account is being used by a third party fraudulently.\n\nThis refund policy does not affect your statutory rights.\n\n \n<b>Rates</b>\n\nOur rates apply to fax pages that take less than 60 seconds to transmit, which covers approximately 90% of all fax pages. Faxes, regardless of size, to numbers that take longer than 60 seconds per page to transmit will be added to a \"slow fax number list\". Next time you send to the same number a surcharge will be added to the price based on the last transmission speed. Should the fax be sent within the 60 seconds per page limit, a refund for the surcharge is issued after completion of the fax job. No special offers apply. German 19% Value Added Tax (VAT) may apply to all charges depending on your country of residence.\n\n \n<b>Change of rates</b>\n\nScendix Software may change the rates at any time by giving a thirty (30) day notice of such change on the website www.pamfax.biz, or by stating new rates in connection with your purchase. The new rate will apply to your next purchase after the adjustments have been published on the website. You agree that by continuing to use PamFax following the adjustments of the rates, you accept the new rates. If you do not wish to accept such adjustment of rates, you may ask for a refund of your PamFax Credit (only not reactivated PamFax Credit is refundable).\n\n \n<b>Payment and tariff Issues</b>\n\nPamFax Credit: You need to pay to use certain products. To purchase payable products you need a sufficient balance of PamFax credit, which is credit purchased by you (or an Administrator of the PamFax Company Manager account) from Scendix and allocated to your User Account (\"PamFax Credit\"). You must deposit sufficient PamFax Credit in your User Account through your debit or credit card, PayPal, promotional voucher, or other means which may be made available by Scendix. Scendix reserves the right to stop accepting debit or credit cards from one or more issuers.\n-\nRestrictions: Scendix does not guarantee that you will be able to use your PamFax Credit balance to purchase all the payable products. Certain products may have to be paid for separately.\n\nInactive PamFax Credit: If You do not use your PamFax Credit for a period of 180 days, we will place your PamFax Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the PamFax Credit by signing into your account and opening the PamFax Portal. There is no charge for reactivation. Scendix does not reactivate PamFax Credit for you. Reactivated PamFax Credit is not refundable.\n\nSign up PamFax Credit bonus: Scendix Software may provide you with a sign up bonus. This is a non-refundable monetary amount automatically added to your PamFax account after account creation. Bonus credit is provided at the sole discretion of Scendix Software and may be changed or removed.\n\n \n<b>Fair use of Service</b>\n\nIn case where Scendix Software finds or suspects unfair use of the Site and/or service, we reserve the right to change, modify, suspend or discontinue user access to any portion of the Site and/or service at any time. We may impose limits on certain features or restrict your access to parts or the entire site and/or service without notice or liability.\n\nPamFax does not charge for failed faxes - independent of cause - except when free credit was used for payment (applies currently to the initial sign up credit and referral credit). When the system encounters other errors or errors related to the PamFax system, either the fax will be resent again at no charge or the total payment amount will be refunded automatically (except when paying with free credit). The fair use policy applies to failed fax sending - as soon as a certain level of failed fax delivery is reached all future failed faxes in the job will be charged for pro-rata. Only failures where a communication cost has occurred will be charged for.\n\n \n<b>Additional terms for the use of Fax Bumber</b>\n\n1. Allocation of your Fax Number. If you have bought and are eligible for a Fax Number, it will be allocated to you as soon as reasonably possible after you have paid us. In certain countries, the number may be allocated to you by Scendix Software's partner instead of Scendix Software and you may need to enter into a separate agreement with such partner. You acknowledge and understand that the allocation and distribution of the number does not constitute any transfer of any property or other rights with respect to the Fax Number(s).\n\n2. PamFax Company Manager. If a Fax Number is allocated to you by the administrator, the right to use the Fax Number and the cancellation of such right will be exercised by the administrator at his sole discretion. Scendix Software shall try to allocate and distribute the requested number and enable you to be reached by PSTN fax machines on your number, where applicable. However, Scendix Software cannot guarantee that the requested Fax Number(s) can be allocated or distributed to you or that you can make use of the Scendix Software services using such number.\n\n3. Termination of Fax Numbers. Scendix Software is entitled to refuse, change or terminate any Fax Number allocated to you at any time for any reason, including but not limited to:\n\n(i) if you don't comply with these Terms of Service or any of the applicable Additional Terms;\n\n(ii) if you don't comply with any instructions given by Scendix Software and/or its partners in relation to the products in accordance with paragraph 5 below; and/or\n\n(iii) if the Fax Number is withdrawn, terminated or changed by any of Scendix Software's partners for any reason.\n\n4. In the event that Scendix Software changes the Fax Number that has been allocated to you, Scendix Software will send a notification by e-mail and/or chat message, stating the effective date of the change and your new Fax Number. If you do not wish to accept this new Fax Number, you are entitled to terminate your Fax Number, in writing or by e-mail to sales@pamhelp.com, with effect from the date on which the new number will be allocated to you.\n\n5. Your co-operation - You agree that you will:\n\n(i) comply with any reasonable instructions given by Scendix Software or Scendix Software's partners with regard to the use of the Fax Number(s) and the products including but not limited to compliance with any terms of service of Scendix Software's partners;\n\n(ii) provide accurate and complete information with regard to your place of residence and your use of the Fax Number(s), and such other information as may reasonably be required from time to time by Scendix Software.\n\n \n\n© 2006-2012 Scendix Software-Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH\nLast revised: October 19, 2012\n",
