It is a separate system. The sandbox API does not really sent faxes. Randomly, some of your faxes will fail in the sandbox to let you test the failure case. Most of the faxes will just be reported as successfully sent, although the fax never really was sent.\nThis also applies to PamFax Credit in the sandbox - it's just virtual money. You can add as much PamFax Credit to your PamFax test account using the function Shopping/AddCreditToUser as you want. You can then use the PamFax Credit to test the sending process. We also provide a test fax number so you can test receiving faxes.\n\nWe have created a new PamFax user for you in the production system and sandbox system with PamFax Credit for testing purposes:\nUser Name: {username}\nPassword: {password}\n\nOnce you have completed the development, send us an email to devsupport@pamfax.biz with a description of the solution and a few screenshots. We will review your solution and will enable access to the production system.\n\nNeed help? We've created a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/pamfax-api-partners\">moderated mailing list for all PamFax API developers</a>.

If you need a list of currency rates PamFax uses, just call Common::ListCurrencies. User’s credit is also returned in user’s currency. The API converts the internally used EUR values to the correct currency for you. This could lead in user’s credit varying from day to day when there are changes in the conversion rate.

Neither the UN-treaty (CISG) nor any other existing or future bilateral or international treaties, even if implemented into German law, shall be applicable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trademarks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trademarks, logos and service marks (\"Marks\") displayed on this Site are the property of PamConsult or other third parties. You are not permitted to use the Marks without the prior written consent of PamConsult or such third party, which may own the Marks. PamConsult, the PamConsult logo are trademarks of PamConsult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fax Privacy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PamConsult acknowledges that documents contain proprietary and confidential information. PamConsult agrees to keep the documents in confidence and to take reasonable precautions to ensure that data is stored securely, no unauthorized individuals have access to the documents and that no unauthorized copies are made. For privacy reasons sent faxes are deleted automatically after one month from your fax history, except the history of Pro Plan subscribers where the history is retained. It is your responsibility to download copies, should you need them. Communication between the PamFax application and our servers is completely SSL encrypted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Payment</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You shall pay PamConsult, via respective payment processing company (Gate2Shop, Paypal or other available payment companies), any applicable rates as stated on the website in connection with your purchase of respective products or services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you purchase Paid-For-Products directly from PamConsult you will be entitled to a cancellation period of fifteen (15) days (a “Cooling-Off Period”) unless you have made use of the Paid-For-Products in any way, in which case the Cooling-Off Period will be extinguished and your purchase cannot be cancelled or refunded. Outside of the Cooling-Off Period, only subscriptions are refundable unless used or expired. Expenditure of PamFax Credit, allocation of a Fax Number, or use of any aspect of a subscription amounts to “use” of a Paid-For-Product. You hereby expressly agree that Fax Numbers may be allocated before the end of the Cooling-Off Period. The Cooling-Off Period and refunds do not apply to Paid-For-Products that are (i) purchased via a third party partner of PamConsult (please contact the partner directly, who may decide in its sole discretion whether or not to pay a refund), (ii) not directly acquired online from PamConsult (e.g. vouchers or pre-paid cards) and (iii) paid for and allocated to your PamConsult Account by a PamFax Company Manager administrator. If you believe that PamConsult has charged you in error, you must contact PamConsult within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges which are more than 90 days old. PamConsult reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably believes (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same Product; (ii) if you are in breach of these Terms or (iii) if PamConsult reasonably suspects that you are using our Products or Software fraudulently or that your User Account is being used by a third party fraudulently. This refund policy does not affect your statutory rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rates</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our rates apply to fax pages that take less than 60 seconds to transmit, which covers approximately 90% of all fax pages. Faxes, regardless of size, to numbers that take longer than 60 seconds per page to transmit will be added to a \"slow fax number list\". Next time you send to the same number a surcharge will be added to the price based on the last transmission speed. Should the fax be sent within the 60 seconds per page limit, a refund for the surcharge is issued after completion of the fax job. No special offers apply. German 19% Value Added Tax (VAT) may apply to all charges depending on your country of residence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Change of rates</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PamConsult may change the rates at any time by giving a thirty (30) day notice of such change on the website www.pamfax.biz, or by stating new rates in connection with your purchase. The new rate will apply to your next purchase after the adjustments have been published on the website. You agree that by continuing to use PamFax following the adjustments of the rates, you accept the new rates. If you do not wish to accept such adjustment of rates, you may ask for a refund of your PamFax Credit (only not reactivated PamFax Credit is refundable).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Payment and tariff Issues</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PamFax Credit: You need to pay to use certain products. To purchase payable products you need a sufficient balance of PamFax credit, which is credit purchased by you (or an Administrator of the PamFax Company Manager account) from PamConsult and allocated to your User Account (\"PamFax Credit\"). You must deposit sufficient PamFax Credit in your User Account through your debit or credit card, PayPal, promotional voucher, or other means which may be made available by PamConsult. PamConsult reserves the right to stop accepting debit or credit cards from one or more issuers. - Restrictions: PamConsult does not guarantee that you will be able to use your PamFax Credit balance to purchase all the payable products. Certain products may have to be paid for separately. Inactive PamFax Credit: If You do not use your PamFax Credit for a period of 180 days, we will place your PamFax Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the PamFax Credit by signing into your account and opening the PamFax Portal. There is no charge for reactivation. PamConsult does not reactivate PamFax Credit for you. Reactivated PamFax Credit is not refundable. Sign up PamFax Credit bonus: PamConsult may provide you with a sign up bonus. This is a non-refundable monetary amount automatically added to your PamFax account after account creation. Bonus credit is provided at the sole discretion of PamConsult and may be changed or removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fair use of Service</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case where PamConsult finds or suspects unfair use of the Site and/or service, we reserve the right to change, modify, suspend or discontinue user access to any portion of the Site and/or service at any time. We may impose limits on certain features or restrict your access to parts or the entire site and/or service without notice or liability. PamFax does not charge for failed faxes - independent of cause - except when free credit was used for payment (applies currently to the initial sign up credit and referral credit). When the system encounters other errors or errors related to the PamFax system, either the fax will be resent again at no charge or the total payment amount will be refunded automatically (except when paying with free credit). The fair use policy applies to failed fax sending - as soon as a certain level of failed fax delivery is reached all future failed faxes in the job will be charged for pro-rata. Only failures where a communication cost has occurred will be charged for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Additional terms for the use of Fax Number</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Allocation of your Fax Number. If you have bought and are eligible for a Fax Number, it will be allocated to you as soon as reasonably possible after you have paid us. In certain countries, the number may be allocated to you by PamConsult's partner instead of PamConsult and you may need to enter into a separate agreement with such partner. You acknowledge and understand that the allocation and distribution of the number does not constitute any transfer of any property or other rights with respect to the Fax Number(s).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. PamFax Company Manager. If a Fax Number is allocated to you by the administrator, the right to use the Fax Number and the cancellation of such right will be exercised by the administrator at his sole discretion. PamConsult shall try to allocate and distribute the requested number and enable you to be reached by PSTN fax machines on your number, where applicable. However, PamConsult cannot guarantee that the requested Fax Number(s) can be allocated or distributed to you or that you can make use of the PamConsult services using such number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Termination of Fax Numbers. PamConsult is entitled to refuse, change or terminate any Fax Number allocated to you at any time for any reason, including but not limited to: (i) if you don't comply with these Terms of Service or any of the applicable Additional Terms; (ii) if you don't comply with any instructions given by PamConsult and/or its partners in relation to the products in accordance with paragraph 5 below; and/or (iii) if the Fax Number is withdrawn, terminated or changed by any of PamConsult's partners for any reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. In the event that PamConsult changes the Fax Number that has been allocated to you, PamConsult will send a notification by e-mail and/or chat message, stating the effective date of the change and your new Fax Number. If you do not wish to accept this new Fax Number, you are entitled to terminate your Fax Number, in writing or by e-mail to sales@pamhelp.com, with effect from the date on which the new number will be allocated to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Your co-operation - You agree that you will: (i) comply with any reasonable instructions given by PamConsult or PamConsult's partners with regard to the use of the Fax Number(s) and the products including but not limited to compliance with any terms of service of PamConsult's partners; (ii) provide accurate and complete information with regard to your place of residence and your use of the Fax Number(s), and such other information as may reasonably be required from time to time by PamConsult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>© 2006-2015 PamConsult Software-Beratungsgesellschaft mbH Last revised: December 16, 2014</p>",
